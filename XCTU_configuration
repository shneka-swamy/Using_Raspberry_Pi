XCTU Configutation - two xbee ports

The power level can be changed to change the distance that the xbee will be transmitting (This change in power can be made in the configuration)
There are two modes available that the xbee can operate on that is either the API mode or the AT(transperent mode)

To get the console log the xbee must be configured in T mode, for this to be done the API must be disabled in the configuration or the 
setting.
After doing this the information can be sent from one xbee to another easily.
