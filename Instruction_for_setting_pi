Raspberry Pi:
The 40 pins available on the sides are referred to as the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)

To configure the IO for receiving general serial input,

1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt

***Then in the config.txt add the following line

enable_uart=1
Then reboot the system. To check if the change has reflected in the system use,

ls -l /dev

(It should show a serial 0 port ttyS0)

Then unless the port is used for console purpose, all the serial console operations must be removed.
Use the following commands,

sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

Then also remove the line console=serial0,115200  from cmdline file.
To open the cmdline file use, sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

To change the serial input from the ttyS0 port to another port (The bluetooth port) use the resource,
