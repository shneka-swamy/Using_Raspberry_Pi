Raspberry Pi:
The 40 pins available on the sides are referred to as the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)

To configure the IO for receiving general serial input,

1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt

***Then in the config.txt add the following line

enable_uart=1
(remember that there is no space inbetween)
Then reboot the system. To check if the change has reflected in the system use,

ls -l /dev

(It should show a serial 0 port ttyS0)

Then unless the port is used for console purpose, all the serial console operations must be removed.
Use the following commands,

sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

Then also remove the line console=serial0,115200  from cmdline file.
To open the cmdline file use, sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

To change the serial input from the ttyS0 port to another port (The bluetooth port) use the resource,

After the configuration is done the working of the xbee to be connected can be checked by using the XCTU
Download from : https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001526/tasks/t_download_and_install_xctu.htm

It is better to use Windows operating system for this part because many internal setting changes must be done.

For problems in installation or further error in connection use,

The xbee if not used for a long time must be reset (This can be done using the XCTU (Tools ->reset)) part.

--------------------------------------

Xbee connected to the shield,
** The xbee connected to the shield will not turn on any LED except for the power LED. Any other LED blinking indicates a fault in the device.
** The shield when being reset will blink the transmitting signal and occassionaly or at the strting the receiver signal.

For identification of the device properly, 
All the settings except for the baudrate can be left as same, Ensure that only 9600 is selected in the baudrate for effective identification 
of the device.
